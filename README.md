# SSMA
This repository will soon contain content for the summer school in (model-based) multivariate analysis.

See https://bertv.folk.ntnu.no/index.html for more details.

## PROGRAM
**This is a preliminary program and thus subject to change**.

The days last from 09:00 to 17:00(ish), and a session after dinner. Each day will consist of a mix of lectures, in-class discussion, live demonstration, and interactive exercises / case studies.

### Monday

* Generalised Linear Models
* Introduction to the gllvm R-package
* Multispecies Generalised Linear Models

## Tuesday

* Accommodating spatial or temporal autocorrelation

## Wednesday
* Ecological gradient theory
* (Model-based) Unconstrained ordination
* Ordination with covariates
* Conditioning and formulating a model for ordination
* Unimodal/quadratic ordination 
* Accommodating nested study designs

## Thursday
* GLLVMs from A-z: application, results, inference
* Participant presentations
* Excurion
